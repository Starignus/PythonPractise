# Raspberry Pi GPIO-Part 1

Your Raspberry Pi is more than just a small computer, it is a hardware prototyping tool! The RPi has **bi-directional I/O pins**, which you can use to drive LEDs, spin motors, or read button presses. To drive the RPi's I/O lines requires a bit or programming. You can use a [variety of programing languages](http://elinux.org/RPi_GPIO_Code_Samples), but we decided to use a really solid, easy tools for driving I/O: **Python**.

##  GPIO Pinout

Raspberry has its GPIO over a standard male header on the board. From the first models to the latest, the header has expanded from 26 pins to 40 pins while maintaining the original pinout.

</p>

There are (at least) two, different numbering schemes you may encounter when referencing **Pi pin numbers**:

1. **Broadcom (SoC) chip-specific** pin numbers.
2. **P1 physical** pin numbers.

You can use either number-system, but when you are programming how to use the pins, it requires that you declare which scheme you are using at the very beginning of your program. We will see this later.

The next table shows all 40 pins on the P1 header, including any particular function they may have, and their dual numbers:

In the next table, we show another numbering system along with the ones we showed above: **Pi pin header numbers and element14 given names, wiringPi numbers, Python numbers, and related silkscreen on the wedge**. The Broadcom pin numbers in the table are related to RPi Model 2 and later only.

This table shows that the RPi not only gives you access to the bi-directional I/O pins, but also [Serial (UART)](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-communication), [I2C](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c), [SPI](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-peripheral-interface-spi), and even some Pulse width modulation ([PWM](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pulse-width-modulation) — “analog output”).


### Analog vs. Digital

Before starting with our practise, we will revise the difference between **analog** and **digital** signals. Both are used to transmit information, usually through **electric signals**. In both these technologies, the information, such as any audio or video, is transformed into electric signals. The **difference between analog and digital**:

* In **analog technology**, information is translated into electric pulses of varying amplitude.

* In **digital technology**, translation of information is into binary format (zero or one) where each bit is representative of two distinct amplitudes.

## Python (RPi.GPIO) API Example

We will use the **RPi.GPIO module** as the driving force behind our Python examples. These Python files and source is included with Raspbian, so assuming you are running the latest Linux distribution, you do not need to download anything to get started. Let's see an example:

1. From your terminal in your laptop connect to your RPi.
2. Create a folder call "code", then a file call "blinker.py":

```bash
$ mkdir code
$ cd code
$ touch blinker.py
```
3. Then we open it with our text editor:

```bash
$ nano blinker.py
```

4. Then, copy the next code in your text editor. This code assumes we have set up the circuit as we arranged above.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python


# External module imports GPIO
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
# Library to slow or give a rest to the script
import time


# Pin definiton using Broadcom scheme
# PWM (Analog)
pwmPin = 18  # Broadcom pin 18 (P1 pin 12)
# Led
ledPin = 23  # Broadcom pin 23 (P1 pin 16)
# Button
butPin = 17  # Broadcom pin 17 (P1 pin 11)

dc = 95  # duty cycle (0 i.e 0%/LOW and 100 ie.e 100%/HIGH) for PWM pin


# Pin Setup:
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)  # Broadcom pin-numbering scheme
GPIO.setup(ledPin, GPIO.OUT)  # LED pin set as output
GPIO.setup(pwmPin, GPIO.OUT)  # PWM pin set as output
# PWM (Analog) Output
pwm = GPIO.PWM(pwmPin, 50)  # Initialize PWM on pwmPin 50Hz frequency
# Button pin set as input w/ pull-up resistors
GPIO.setup(butPin, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)


# Initial state for LEDs:
GPIO.output(ledPin, GPIO.LOW)
# This function set an initial value of the frequency
pwm.start(dc)


print("Here we go! Press CTRL+C to exit")
try:
    while 1:
        # The input() function will return either a True or False
        # indicating whether the pin is HIGH or LOW.
        if GPIO.input(butPin):  # button is released
            pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(dc)  # Adjust the value of the PWM output
            GPIO.output(ledPin, GPIO.LOW)
        else:  # button is pressed:
            pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(100-dc)
            GPIO.output(ledPin, GPIO.HIGH)
            # Delay of 75 milliseconds
            time.sleep(0.075)
            GPIO.output(ledPin, GPIO.LOW)
            # Delay of 75 milliseconds
            time.sleep(0.075)
except KeyboardInterrupt:  # If CTRL+C is pressed, exit cleanly:
    pwm.stop()  # stop PWM
    GPIO.cleanup()  # cleanup all GPIO

```

5. Running the script needs administrator privileges because of the RPi.GPIO module requires it. So we run the following commands:

To make the script an executable:

```bash
$ sudo chmod u+x blinker.py
$ ./blinker.py
```

With the code running, press the button to turn on the digital LED. The PWM-ing LED will invert its brightness when you press the button as well.

## Python (RPi.GPIO) API: Overview of the basic function calls used in our example.

### Setup Section

* When we use Python to control our GPIO pins, we always need to import the corresponding Python module, which goes at the top of the script:

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
```

In here, we are giving a shorter name to the module "GPIO", to call the module through our script.

* It is important to define which of the two **pin-numbering schemes** you want to use:
  1. ```GPIO.BOARD```– **Board numbering scheme**. The pin numbers follow the **pin numbers on header P1**.
  2. ```GPIO.BCM``` – **Broadcom chip-specific pin numbers**. These pin numbers follow the lower-level numbering system defined by the Raspberry Pi’s Broadcom-chip brain.

To specify in your code which number-system is being used, use the GPIO.setmode() function as:

```python
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
```
This will activate the Broadcom-chip specific pin numbers.

### Setting a Pin Mode

You have to declare a “pin mode” before you can use it as either an input or output. To set a pin mode, use the ```setup([pin], [GPIO.IN, GPIO.OUT]``` function. So, if you want to set pin 18 (in the BCM) or 12 (in the BOARD) as an output, for example:

```python
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)
```

### Output

#### Digital Output

To write a pin high or low, use the ```GPIO.output([pin], [GPIO.LOW, GPIO.HIGH])``` function. For example, if you want to set pin 18 (in the BCM) high:

```python
GPIO.output(18, GPIO.HIGH)
```

Writing a pin to ```GPIO.HIGH``` will drive it to 3.3V, and ```GPIO.LOW``` will set it to 0V. For the lazy, alternative to ```GPIO.HIGH``` and ```GPIO.LOW```, you can use either ```1```, ```True```, ```0``` or ```False``` to set a pin value.

#### Pulse-width Modulation (PWM-“Analog”) Output

To initialize PWM, use ```GPIO.PWM([pin], [frequency])``` function. To make the rest of your script-writing easier, you can assign that instance to a variable. Then use ```pwm.start([duty cycle])``` function to set an initial value. For example, we can set PWM to pin up with a frequency of 1kHz, and set that output to a 50% duty cycle:

```python
pwm = GPIO.PWM(18, 1000)
pwm.start(50)
```

To adjust the value of the PWM output, use the ```pwm.ChangeDutyCycle([duty cycle])``` function. ```[duty cycle]``` can be any value between 0 (i.e 0%/LOW) and 100 (ie.e 100%/HIGH). So to set a pin to 75% on, for example, you could write:

```python
pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(75)
```

To turn PWM on that pin off, use the ```pwm.stop()``` command. Just don’t forget to set the pin as an output before you use it for PWM.

### Inputs

If a pin is configured as an input, you can use the ```GPIO.input([pin])``` function to read its value. The ```input()``` function will return either a ```True``` or ```False``` indicating whether the pin is HIGH or LOW. You can use an if statement to test this. For example, in the next lines of code the GPIO library will read pin 17 (in the BCM) and print whether it is being read as HIGH or LOW:

```python
if GPIO.input(17):
    print("Pin 11 is HIGH")
else:
    print("Pin 11 is LOW")
```
#### Pull-Up/Down Resistors

In the ```GPIO.setup()``` function, we saw above, where we declared whether a pin was an input or output, we can use a third parameter to set pull-up or pull-down resistors: ```pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP``` or ```pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN```. For example, to use a pull-up resistor on GPIO 17 (in the BCM), write this into your setup:

```python
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)
```

If nothing is declared in that third value, both pull-resistors will be disabled.

### Others

#### Setting up delays

If you need to slow down your Python script, you can add delays by incorporating the [time module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html) at the top of your script as:

```python
import time
```

Then, you can use ```time.sleep([seconds])``` to give your script a rest. You can use decimals to precisely set your delay. For example, to delay 250 milliseconds, write:

```python
time.sleep(0.25)
```

### Garbage Collecting

Once your script has run its course, be kind to the next process that might use your GPIOs by cleaning up after yourself. Use the ```GPIO.cleanup()``` command at the end of your script to release any resources your script may be using. Your RPi will survive if you forget to add this command, but it is good practice to include wherever you can.
