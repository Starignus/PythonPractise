# Why Arduino?

RPi and Arduino are complementary platforms and one doesn't exclude the other. If you combine their capabilities you can achieve amazing results. But why?
  * The community! Arduino has a lot of materials readily available online, from libraries, to examples. If you have something in mind probably someone has already done it and shared the documentation.
  * You might have a project that is already working on Arduino, but you might need just a bit more processing power, so the Raspberry can come to the rescue.
  * The RPi doesn't go well with 5V logic levels, it only operates with 3.3V and its pins do not accommodate 5V.
  * If you fry an Arduino you can replace the damaged microcontroller chip easily for less than £10. That gives you the freedom to experiment a bit more, without damaging the RPi.
  * Raspbian operating system doesn't have real-time control capabilities, whereas a microcontroller like Arduino can handle those operations.


To chose between the two there's is this [Make:zine article](http://makezine.com/2015/12/04/admittedly-simplistic-guide-raspberry-pi-vs-arduino/) that can help you out.


# What is more advanced than an Arduino?

[//]: # (TODO: expand)

  - Arduino
      - ATMega / ATTiny / SAMD21 ARM M0
  - Raspberry Pi

  - Beaglebone
  - ARM mBed
  - STM32
  - ESP8266
  - Teensy
  - pyboard
      - STM32 ARM Cortex M4
      - 168MHz
      - Runs microPython (comparison and guide with microPython vs. Arduino)

  Specific enhanced capabilities

  - Bluetooth - integration with smartphone apps
  - Wifi - integration with web apps
  - True analog output (DAC)
  - Lower power
  - Higher clock speed (~10–100 MHz) / running more powerful tasks (e.g. computer vision)
