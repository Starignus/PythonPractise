Notes: I produced the initial online teaching material for the Gizmo module run by the Dyson School of Design Engineering at Imperial College London. An updated version of the material is now available on this [repository](https://github.com/ImperialDyson/Gizmo) in its [GitHub space](https://github.com/ImperialDyson).
